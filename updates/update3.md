"Rule 101." it booms, with an infinite, cosmic voice. "I am the holder of
MONEYS, KARMA and the one to be SATISFIED with INTENTS or not."

"I"
"am"
"AGORA."

"...Does that answer your question?" it then asks, returning to looking
divine, but a lot less intimidatingly so. "I'm the avatar of Agora that
holds in-game assets and the sort."

- Stab your newfound KILLBLADE into them
- Inform the other Agorans about this
- Attempt to SEDUCE AGORA with very SENSUAL MOVEMENTS
- (Write-in)

Also, from now on, I'll roll a 1d100 to see how well you do an action, if
it requires it (like fighting or doing something challenging). Rolling high
is good, rolling low is bad. More tabletop RPG-like
