Hey, welcome to AGORA QUEST. This is an interactive story - you pay me 10
coins along what you want the protagonist to do, and I'll count it as a
vote (voting, woo! nomic!!) and then when I have time to continue this,
I'll tally the votes and progress the story based on that. I'll tiebreak if
there are any ties. Also, you only get to vote once between updates.

For your vote, you can choose one of the options I give you in the vein of
those Choose-Your-Adventure books, or you can just make up your own.

You're a new PLAYER in AGORA! A fresh, sparkling feeling of EXCITEMENT
fills you and in your naivety, you are yet not OVERWHELMED by the RULESET.

So, what do you do?

- Go look at what that bottomless pit marked "CFJ ARCHIVES" is all about.
- Check out "OFF:", whatever that is.
- Look for other Agorans and what they're doing.
