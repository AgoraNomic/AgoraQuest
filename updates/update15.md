**STEALTH ROLL: SUCCESS**

![Behind the ruleset, Lady Cat sits atop the shackled avatar of Agora. Top Hat Man stands to the side. The player character looks at the scene with alarm from behind the ruleset monolith.](../images/update15a.png)

You... see it. It's AGORA - that god-like, formal entity that sometimes
holds money and other things, with shackles and several scamblades stuck
into its body... subjugating it. somehow? There are tubes protruding from
the ground as well, pumping something into these shackles and scamblades,
making them gradually grow larger. TOP HAT MAN is there, and so is CAT.

"Are you sure you're going to be able to ride em correctly?" TOP HAT asks,
for him to then snap his fingers, causing another CFJ tube to emerge from
the ground and stick into the scam-black bondage. "I'm soon done here with
the CFJs."

"Yeah, I got this, Hat." CAT replies, tugging on a chain in her hand,
causing the avatar of AGORA to spasm violently for a moment, almost making
her fall off. "...I think."

"Careful now. Remember the script. Don't deviate." TOP HAT instructs.
"Alright?"

"Yeah, yeah." she mutters.

"Very well then." TOP HAT adds, and snaps his fingers, causing the tubes to
collectively unplug and slowly retreat back into the ground. "I wish you
the best of luck then, CAT."

![Top Hat Man stands smiling among several bent pipes protruding from the ground, face obscured by shadow.](../images/update15b.png)

Then, he too sinks into the ground, and disappears.

"Hey, could you teach me that trick too sometime!" CAT barks, but too late,
TOP HAT MAN was gone.

![Lady Cat looks downward maliciously while wrangling with several lengths of black chain.](../images/update15c.png)

"Alrightalrightalright." CAT then told herself, and exhaled deeply. Then,
her eye bolted open with enthusiasm, and she pulled on the chains that were
affixed to the deity. "Let's... gooo, go-go-go!" she hissed. "DICTATORSHIP,
here I come!"

And at her command, the god lurched forwards.
