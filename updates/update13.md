title: Check out if you can contribute to society and get a job or something by becoming an OFFICER.

You decide to get a job! That OFF: place seemed promising (it started with
OFF-, like OFFICERS!), and if your previous skimming of the ruleset was
right, then there should be reports about officers... somewhere. Might as
well start here.

![The player looks over a vast expanse toward a large building with Greek columns labeled "OFF:".](../images/update13a.png)

You enter the building, finding TOP HAT MAN inside.

"Welcome back!" he tells you in a chipper tone, holding his pipe. "Looking
for something?"

"Yeah, some OFFICER work." you tell him. "I've read that it pays?"

"Sure does." he replies, and gestures to one of the framed pieces of paper
on the wall. The frames themselves seemed ornate and well taken care of,
but you could notice the faded tone and quality of them being quite aged.
However, the papers within seemed very new in comparison, many had the
bleach-white sheen of being freshly printed.

"We're always open to newbies taking up new positions." he affirms.

"I'd have to take part in some... ELECTIONS, right? To earn the spot?" you
ask.

"Well, yes... but they're not a big deal." he chuckles. "They're most of
the time just a formality. There's rarely any actual competition."

"...Oh."

![Three options for officer duties are shown on top of pedestals. To the left, Tailor is represented by a ribbon and a pair of scissors, in the middle is the Referee's cold hand of justice, and on the right is a yellow chest representing the Treasuror](../images/update13c.png)

  once per REPORT.
